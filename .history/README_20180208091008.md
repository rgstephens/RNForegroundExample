This is a React Native Foreground Service example app.  The `react-native init` [command](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) was used to create the initial project and the [react-native-create-library](https://github.com/frostney/react-native-create-library) tool was used as a start for the foreground service.

## Main Component

The app starts a loop that runs every 10 seconds and displays the elapsed time (should be 10 seconds). There's a switch at the top of the screen to enable/disable the foreground service. The loop pushes a timestamp into the Redux store which is read by the main component.
